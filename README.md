# PurdueHealthHub
An Android app that serves as a health-information center for Purdue students and faculty

A centralized health-information center is needed now more than ever. The on-going spread of COVID-19 has taken its toll on the physical and mental health of millions worldwide. 
According to the CDC, anxiety disorder symptoms were reported 3 times more than in 2019. Depressive disorder symptoms were reported 4 times more than in 2019. 
Here at Purdue, we all realize that we must do our part in Protecting Purdue. How can we do this more efficiently?

Purdue Health Hub realizes the value that Purdueâ€™s health services (PUSH, CAPS, CARE) offer to students. 
That is why we want to make it even EASIER for Purdue students to access these resources! 
Within the Android App, students can learn more about the free services offered to them as students. 
They can answer a short personalized COVID-19 quiz to best deal with their specific situation and can also schedule their required flu shot. 
Together, with the help of Purdue Health Hub, we can Protect Purdue!
